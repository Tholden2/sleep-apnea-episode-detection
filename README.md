# sleep-apnea-episode-detection

Everything should run fairly easily assuming all files are in the same directory. Simply uncomment only one of the rawData loading lines to observe that collection. The only other parameters requiring changing are the variables episode start time and episode end time. The updates required can be seen in the comment following each rawData load. The cfg file is included so the change to the parameters can be seen and the npy files are for the rawData load. Run each cell and the final cell will include the prediction graph along with the evaluation metrics.
